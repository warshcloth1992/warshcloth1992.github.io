  <h2>Cover Letter</h2>
    <p>I have been working since I was 15, when I began my job at U-Save foods. During my time at U-Save, I went from cashier to Assistant Manager of Produce. In this position, I managed the produce department which included quality management of stock, as well as customer service. After three years in this position, I moved on to working for Polaris Industries. At the Polaris factory I was quickly promoted from assembler to auditor. In this position I monitored the machinery and ensured the safety of my fellow employees and the quality of the products we assembled. I started working at LSS of MN as a part-time employee while working for Polaris. However, I left Polaris when my manager asked me to take the supervisory position after only three months. I was with LSS for just over 18 months. I moved to the metro area a few months ago for more opportunity and an education. I started working at Uponor and began management classes, at MCTC, after a year. While attending school I’m looking for a company that can help me achieve my career goals in leadership.
My past experience, positive attitude, dependability, Patience and my willingness to learn make me an ideal candidate for this position. 
Thank you for your consideration,
Michah Mckinney</p>
